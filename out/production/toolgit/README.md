This project is a Library Management System developed as part of the
Software Engineering Tools and Practices (SETP) course.

The system was first designed using UML diagrams in ArgoUML and then
converted into Java source code. Git and GitHub were used for version
control and collaboration

## Tools and Technologies Used
- ArgoUML – for UML class diagram design and Java code generation
- Java – programming language
- VS Code – code editor
- Git – version control system
- GitHub – remote repository and pull request management

---

## System Description
The system contains the following main classes:
- Book
- Author
- Member
- Librarian
- Loan

A book can have one or more authors.
Members can borrow and return books through the Loan class.
Librarians manage the addition and removal of books.

---

## Git Commands Used
- git init – initialize a local Git repository
- git add – stage files for commit
- git commit – save changes to the repository
- git branch – create a new branch
- git checkout – switch between branches
- git merge – merge branches
- git push – upload local changes to GitHub
- git pull – fetch and merge changes from GitHub

---

## Branching and Merging Workflow
- The main branch contains the stable version of the project.
- A feature branch called LoanManagement was created.
- Loan functionality (borrow and return book) was implemented in the branch.
- The branch was pushed to GitHub.
- A Pull Request (PR) was created and merged into the main branch.

---

## Version Control Concepts Applied
- Commit history tracking
- Branching for feature development
- Pull Requests for code review
- Merging changes into the main branch
